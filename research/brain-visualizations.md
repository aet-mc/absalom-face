# Visual Inspiration Research

## Key Inspirations

### 1. Activation Atlases (Distill.pub)
Global maps of neural concepts with hierarchical zoom. Philosophy: "map the forest, not trees"
https://distill.pub/2019/activation-atlas/

### 2. Anthropic's Feature Mapping
Proved you can extract millions of interpretable features from production LLMs, with measurable "concept distances"
https://www.anthropic.com/research/mapping-mind-language-model

### 3. Refik Anadol's Machine Hallucinations
Treats data as sculptural material; continuous motion through latent space creates meditative awe
https://refikanadol.com/

### 4. Casey Reas' Process
Simple instruction-based systems generate emergent complexity. "The rules are the artwork"
https://reas.com/

### 5. Human Connectome Project
Pathways not just nodes; directional color-coding; navigation through the brain
https://www.humanconnectome.org/

### 6. Physarum Slime Mold Simulations
Zero-intelligence emergence. The network IS the computation. Tokyo rail optimization in living tissue.

### 7. Ryoji Ikeda's Datamatics
Ultra-minimal "pure data" aesthetics. Error codes and binary as sublime
https://www.ryojiikeda.com/

### 8. Brendan Bycroft's LLM Viz
Navigate a running transformer in 3D. Computation as physical space.
https://bbycroft.net/llm

### 9. DeepDream
Feedback amplification reveals internal representations; alien pareidolia

### 10. BertViz
Attention as relationship arcs between tokens; multi-head plurality
https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz

## What's Missing (Our Opportunities)

1. **Temporal dynamics** — thought *happening*, not snapshots
2. **Memory visualization** — stored knowledge, not just attention
3. **Multi-scale unity** — seamless global → local zoom
4. **Interactive manipulation** — sculpt AI thoughts in real-time
5. **Self-reflection** — AI visualizing its own cognition as it thinks

## Design Principles to Steal

- **From Activation Atlases**: Hierarchical zoom, semantic clustering
- **From Refik Anadol**: Fluid motion, data as sculpture, meditative pace
- **From Slime Mold**: Emergent pathways, no central control
- **From Connectome**: Color-coded directionality, pathway prominence
- **From BertViz**: Relationship arcs, multi-head visualization
